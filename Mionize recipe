First add the milk,salt,sugar.
Then add vinegar/silica.
then keep adding Oil to the mixture until gets really thick.
Be carful here and don't add to much oil or else it will go sour.
But if ti does then just add a bit more milk and then it will be just fine.
And if you want it really thick then use a hand blender .
Done !!!!!!!! ;)
